ðŸš€ Responsive Landing Page - Task 01 Completed! ðŸŽ¯

As part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech, I built an interactive navigation menu for a Responsive Landing Page. The goal was to create a fixed navigation bar that changes its style on scroll and on hover, using:

âœ… HTML for structure
âœ… CSS for styling and responsiveness
âœ… JavaScript for interactivity

This task helped me improve my front-end development skills by implementing dynamic UI behavior that enhances user experience. Excited to take on more challenges and continue growing in web development! ðŸ’»âœ¨
